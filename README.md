I worked on Sketch between 2012 and the end of 2017, but I'm now back as an indie developer at [Elegant Chaos](http://elegantchaos.com). If you need some Sketch plugin consultancy or contracting, I may be able to help you out.

## About

I started this repo when I was doing a little bit of contracting on Sketch, and wanted to experiment with the scripting capabilities.

I now work for Bohemian, but the repo hasn't entirely caught up with that fact!

Currently it contains a few experiments and examples. When (if) I have the time, I intend to expand it...

## Installation

Copy these scripts into your Sketch plugins folder.

This is in ~/Library/Application Support/sketch/Plugins/.

## Scripts

The Export scripts illustrate a way to export from all documents, rather than just the front one.

The Move To Back script illustrates how to execute a menu command, if you know the action for it.

The Log Example script is an experiment - it lets you log messages from your other scripts to an actual log window. No more rummaging around in the console...

## Library

All of these scripts use the elegantchaos.js library. This needs to be present in the Plugins/ folder too.

I intend to build up a bunch of useful stuff in this library. Eventually this stuff might get bundled in with Sketch, but for now it is completely unofficial.
